BlueWatch Lab
BlueWatch Lab is an immersive, cutting-edge project designed to create a virtualized cyber defense environment where security monitoring, threat detection, and attack simulation come to life. It brings together the power of open-source technologies and real-world attack scenarios, providing an interactive playground for cybersecurity professionals, students, and enthusiasts to sharpen their skills.

🚀 Key Objectives
.Simulate Real-World Networks:
Build a realistic corporate network complete with servers, workstations, and a domain controller, mimicking enterprise-grade IT infrastructures.

.Implement Advanced Security Monitoring:
Deploy Splunk as a powerful SIEM solution to collect, analyze, and visualize security events across the virtual network.

.Detect and Respond to Live Threats:
Launch realistic attack simulations and practice real-time incident response and forensic analysis.

.Enhance Practical Cybersecurity Skills:
Master the art of network security, system hardening, threat hunting, and security analysis through hands-on lab exercises.

🛠️ Technologies Used
Technology | Purpose
VirtualBox | Virtualization platform for lab environment
Ubuntu Server | Hosting Splunk Enterprise (SIEM)
Windows 10 | Workstation endpoint with Sysmon + Splunk UF
Windows Server | Domain Controller (Active Directory services)
Kali Linux | Attack simulation and penetration testing
Sysmon | Endpoint system monitoring and event logging
Splunk | Security Information and Event Management


🧩 Lab Architecture
Ubuntu VM:
🖥 Hosts Splunk Enterprise for centralized log management and security analytics.

Windows 10 VM:
💻 Emulates an employee workstation with Sysmon and Splunk Universal Forwarder for deep endpoint monitoring.

Windows Server VM:
🛡 Acts as the domain controller, managing authentication, group policies, and network resources.

🎯 Attack Simulation
Use Kali Linux to execute guided attack scenarios like:
Brute-force attacks
Privilege escalation
Lateral movement
Data exfiltration


Witness how these attacks generate logs, alarms, and security events captured by Splunk, providing a full incident detection and analysis cycle.

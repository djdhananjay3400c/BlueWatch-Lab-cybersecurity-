# BlueWatch-Lab-cybersecurity-
BlueWatch Lab is a comprehensive project focused on creating a virtualized environment for security monitoring, threat detection, and attack simulation. This lab leverages open-source tools and virtualization technologies to provide a hands-on experience for cybersecurity professionals, students, and enthusiasts.
Key Objectives:

Simulate a real-world network environment: The lab replicates a typical corporate network, complete with servers, workstations, and a domain controller.

Implement security monitoring: Splunk is used as a Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) system to collect, analyze, and visualize security-related data.

Detect and respond to threats: The lab is designed to simulate various attack scenarios, allowing users to practice their incident response skills.

Enhance security skills: By working through the lab exercises, users can gain practical experience in network security, system administration, and security analysis.

Technologies Used:

Virtualization: VirtualBox

Operating Systems: Ubuntu, Windows 10, Windows Server

SIEM: Splunk

Attack Simulation: Kali Linux

System Monitoring: Sysmon

Lab Setup:

The lab environment consists of the following virtual machines:

Ubuntu VM:  Hosts Splunk Enterprise for centralized log management and analysis.

Windows 10 VM:  Represents a typical workstation in the network, equipped with Splunk Universal Forwarder and Sysmon for data collection.

Windows Server VM:  Acts as the domain controller, managing user authentication and network resources.

Attack Simulation:

The lab includes a series of guided attack simulations using Kali Linux. These simulations demonstrate common attack vectors, such as brute-force attacks, and allow users to observe how these attacks are logged and detected by Splunk.

Benefits:

Hands-on experience with industry-standard security tools.

Realistic simulation of network environments and attack scenarios.

Improved skills in security monitoring, threat detection, and incident response.

Cost-effective solution for cybersecurity training and education.
